# SEP 1

<p>
  This is the very first Semester Project I helped make, during my study at VIA University College.
  <br>
  This is a Project Management System, implemented entirely in <a href="https://www.java.com/">Java</a>, using <a href="https://openjfx.io/">JavaFX</a> to handle GUI. The GUI was designed with <a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/">SceneBuilder</a>, using the Click & Drag feature to quickly create a Scene / View.
  <br>
  <br>
  Overall, this is a very simple system, storing data in a simple binary file, used for reloading data later.
